In this example, we're using an LSTM model with four layers, each with 50 units. We're also applying a dropout rate of 0.2 to each LSTM layer, which will randomly drop out 20% of the input units during training to prevent overfitting. Finally, we're adding a dense layer with a single output unit, which will be used to predict a single target value.

To train the model, we're using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. We're also splitting the data into training and testing sets and using the validation_data parameter to evaluate the model's performance on the testing set after each epoch of training.
